Some people find javascript to be a little confusing, but I take you step by step through real world examples so that you can learn the easy way... By doing! What is Javascript?

What's the course about? Web development - Plain and simple. Everyone needs a website, whether it's to market your business, sell your new e-book, make money through advertising and affiliate marketing, or just for your family. The problem is that it just seems so difficult to create, and so really expensive to get someone else to do it for you. Try Google ""custom website design"" and see what you find. You'll find companies offering to design a site for $500, $1000, and more. And don't forget the monthly fee, which can be anything from $50 upwards. So, that's not an option for most of us, unless you have your own private jet - in which case you can probably buy the website design company. The other option is to create your own website. However this sends tremors of fear rippling through your body as you imagine weeks and months of trying to learn Javascript, HTML, XML, and what the 'L. Or maybe you can try and master Wordpress. Some say that is not too hard. Yeah sure! It's also not too hard to do a backflip on a trampoline (or so I'm told). But you're likely to hurt yourself trying. The Web Development Solution - A simple drag and drop way to design a website. This course will show you how to use an awesome online website creator to design the most professional looking site possible. In fact I will start of by letting you watch me create an amazing website in underminutes. Yes, that's correct. It is possible to create a fully functional, professional website inminutes, if you know how! And I will show you how to do just that! By the end of the course...actually by the end of the first section you will be able to create a website inminutes too! I'll show you how to develop a website that includes videos, images, contact forms, a blog, twitter feeds, contact forms and more. And you do not need to know anything about website creation, HTML or anything else. It's simply copy/paste, drag/brag! We will also cover other important things (after you've mastered creating your site) such as choosing a domain name, buying a domain, getting images and video, etc. And to really make sure the website you develop is not only awesome but professional and money generating, there is a section where I will share Power Tips from the experts. Tips on getting free resources, making sure your website looks professional, making sure your website is found in Google (Search Engine Optimisation), and even some power tips on how to turn your website into a money making machine! What kind of materials are included? Everything you need for web devlopment will be explained. In fact you will be so good you could even start creating websites for others and making money. The course will consist of some really easy, professional, step-by-step videos that show you how to create your website. I mean professional...both in presentation and recording. This is not just some guy mumbling ramblings into a webcam! Plus there are downloadable tip sheets, and more. This is the ultimate web development guide!

And that will take you just over minutes of learning! Seems unbelievable, but I guarantee it! Thereafter Sectionsandwill extend your ability, in the same easy way as Section helping you create the most amazing website possible. How is this web development course structured? This is an action course. So the course starts with getting to the doing straight away. Sure there is lots of ""fluff"" like choosing domains, and sourcing images etc which is important, but that is left till later.

If you're new to compression, you will learn how to produce high quality video for distributing over the web, watching on your computer or smart TV/console, for inserting into iBooks or to record onto DVDs and Blu-ray discs. If you know the basics of compression, this course will serve as a valuable reference for questions that inevitably arise when encoding video, like what's the best key frame setting for web video (Lesson, what's the best way to work with x264 (Lesson) or how do I implement HTML5 (Lessons and). All lessons contain video, most integrating both PowerPoint instruction and screencam demos. All lessons longer than ten minutes are annotated so you can quickly find the content most important to you. Most lessons have links to other Internet-based resources. This course has six major sections: Terms and technologies (95 minutes) provides an overview of codecs and compression, basic encoding configurations (resolution/frame rate/data rate) and then looks at configuration options like bitrate control (VBR, CBR), frame types (I-, B- and P-frames) and container formats. Then it looks at audio encoding parameters (sample rate/channels/data rate), deinterlacing and aspect ratio issues. The section concludes with a look at three free and essential tools, MediaInfo, Bitrate Viewer and MPEG Streamclip. Codecs (52 minutes). This section walks you through a brief history of codecs used in streaming, DVD and Blu-ray and cameras and intermediate codecs used in editing. Then three lessons introduce you to H.264, with a final lesson on using x264. Encoding Recipes (62 minutes). These lessons provide specific instruction for those producing video for uploading to UGC/OVP sites, for playing on mobile devices, for local or TV/console playback, for streaming from a web site, burning onto a DVD or Blu-ray disc or inserting into iBooks Author. Encoding Programs (126 minutes). All encoding programs have idiosyncrasies when it comes to producing streaming video. In these tutorials, for Apple Compressor1, Adobe Media Encoder, Sorenson Squeeze, Telestream Episode and HandBrake, you'll learn these idiosyncrasies and learn to efficiently produce high quality video ideal for your target uses. Distributing Your Web Video (34 minutes). This section teaches you how to distribute your video over the web. First it outlines your distribution options, including user generated content sites, online video platforms or from your own website via HTML5. Then it provides focused tutorials that show you how to distribute with all three options. Optimizing Your Source Videos (68 minutes). You can't have high quality streaming video without high quality video. In these lessons, you'll learn to optimize your source footage in Premiere Pro, FCPand X and to remove noise with the Neat Video filter. Then you'll learn to clean your audio in Audition, FCPX, and iZotope RX3, which produces the best quality of the three. The penultimate lesson discusses audio compression, a technique which can improve the clarity of your encoded audio, and the final lesson shows how to declip audio recorded too loudly. By the end of the course, you will know how to encode video for optimal quality and playback performance on a variety of platforms, including computers, mobile devices, SmartTVs and console devices (Roku/Apple TV) plus for recording onto DVD and Blu-ray discs.

You will learn everything about web worker within an hour. One of the many design goals of the JavaScript language was to keep it single-threaded and, by extension, simple. Though I must admit that, given the idiosyncrasies of the language constructs, it is anything but simple! But what we mean by being �single-threaded� is that there is only one thread of control in JavaScript; yes, sadly, your JavaScript engine can do only one thing at a time. Now, doesn�t that sound too restrictive to make use of multi-core processors lying idle on your machine? HTML5 promises to change all of that. As envisioned by WHATWG, web workers are relatively heavy-weight. They are expected to be long-lived, have a high start-up performance cost, and a high per-instance memory cost.

A basic understanding of concepts in statistics is helpful but not required.,Recognize what business intelligence (BI) is. Explore how business intelligence works on a theoretical basis. Identify what steps firms need to take to implement business intelligence. Identify areas where business intelligence can alter the way a company conducts operations.,"Business Intelligence (BI); the term is bandied about so frequently today that it might seem like everyone except you already understands it. The truth is that like its partner �Big Data�, business intelligence is actually not well understood at all. Most people who talk about business intelligence have at best a general notion of what it means and almost no experience with actually using BI in a meaningful way. However, BI is an important new tool for modern business. Advances in computing power can now give businesses ways to analyze data that they never could before. With these advances, firms can make decisions about pricing, marketing, new products, and resource allocation more effectively than they have ever been able to in the past. Major corporations like Kroger are starting to use BI to help determine what products they should advertise to specific customers. General Electric is using BI to more efficiently run its industrial maintenance schedules. Citi is using BI to help proactively figure out the maximum interest rates various customers are willing to pay. BI is useful in all of these settings and much more. If you would like Continuing Education Credit (e.g. CPE, CE, CPD, etc.) for this course, it is available if you take this course on the Illumeo dot com platform under course title: The Fundamentals of Business Intelligence (BI): What it Does and Why it's so Essential. Illumeo is certified to provide CPE in over two dozen different professional certifications covering finance, accounting, treasury, internal audit, HR, and more. However, in order to receive CPE credit the courses must be taken on an �approved-by-the-governing-body� CPE platform, and for over two dozen corporate professional certifications, that is the Illumeo platform.

You�ll also have a head start over other developers using obsolete tools and earlier versions of Android. ndroid is continually being updated and you'll learn how to target but users of current versions of Android and older versions as well. ith this course, you get the best of both worlds. ou�re taught to write code for Android that works with the current version and older versions of Android by using the AppCompat library. That way, the apps you build will work with more versions of Android, giving you access to a wider audience of users. Starting is easy because no previous programming experience is needed. ONE! If you do have it, great. Or maybe you just want to brush up on your Android development skills, and that�s fantastic too. The course is presented using a combination of video, slides and diagrams, all designed to teach you everything you need to know. Here is what just one student thinks about the course. ""If you are thinking of learning how to develop an Android app, you should be doing this course. It is comprehensive and covers so many aspects of programming an Android app. The best part is that Tim explains and teaches you how to become an independent developer. Since completing this course, I have gone on and developed my own application, which is now published on the Google Play Store! Developing an app takes patience, and it is definitely worthwhile going through all the content in this course. Daniel Lee. Should you write Android apps that target only the very latest version of Android? If you have an iPhone or iPad, chances are high that you update each year to the latest iOS release most users do. The situation is completely different with Android. Only a relatively small percentage of Android users update their phones annually. If you write your apps to only support the latest version of Android, you will ensure% of your potential user base will never see your app. The Google app store will only show apps that a users Android device can run, so if their device is not running the latest version of Android, they won't even be able to find your app on the Google play app store! How do you make sure your app targets older versions of Android? Android development is less about making sure you are creating apps that work with the latest version of Android, and more about ensuring your apps work with whatever versions of Android your users are running. Google are aware of this problem and have something call the AppCompat library. Which is a way for you to ensure your apps work on older devices. This is not enabled by default. Meaning that if you do not specifically configure your app to use this library and target older devices and newer ones, it either won't show up at all for users searching for your app, or older Android devices running your app might crash because they are trying to access features that do not exist in their version of Android. The key is to use this library. And that's what you will learn in this course. Does that mean that your apps can only use features from really old Android versions? No it does not. The AppCompat library is constantly updated by Google. They go back and add features to the library which allows older Android devices to access newer features of Android. But again, this is not turned on by default. You have to create and write your Android apps in a particular way to have your Android app be able to work correctly for current and older versions of Android. Should you learn Kotlin? Now that Google are pushing so hard for Android developers to useKotlin, we are seeing a dramatic shift to Kotlin It's similar to the iOS situation a few years ago with Objective-C when Apple released Swift. Fast forward a few years and everyone is using Swift. This is starting to happen with Android app development. Developers who used to use Java are switching to Kotlin. You can see whyGoogle want this to happen. They have been in court numerous times withOracle(the owners of Java) relating to a dispute over the use of theJava language. Google want developers to adopt Kotlin so that they don't have to worry about Java any more. The recent Google I/O conference show mainly Kotlin code examples. You can see where we are heading. Kotlin is the future for Android app development. Soon there will be fewJava developers writing Android apps they will be using Kotlin. The good news is, we've bundled a completeKotlin tutorial we wrote from scratch with the course. So not only do we use Kotlin in this course(teaching best practices along the way), but we also include a complete Kotlin tutorial as well. You will learn how to use the Kotlin language in this course. This is what you�ll learn in the course: Develop apps for the very latest version of Android that also work on older Android devices running older versions of the Android operating system. Download, install and configure the necessary (free) software. Create your first app. Build a range of apps demonstrating key aspects of the Android framework. Test your apps on emulators or a real Android phone or tablet. You�ll learn Kotlin programming because Google are recommending and pushing adoption of Kotlin forAndroid app development. Included are Kotlin tutorial videos that will get you up to speed fast. Ensure your apps work with current and older Android versions on phones and tablets. Use Android studio the newest version of Google's premier Android tool. Learn how to use databases, web services, and even get your apps to speak! Understand the all new Constraint layout, for ""drag and drop"" screen creation. Use powerful libraries of code to play videos, download website data, manipulate images, and a whole lot more! Toreinforce what you�ve learnt. during the course, there are numerous challenges designed to help you understand each concept being taught. You�re also shown the solution to the challenge so you know you�re always on the right track. The course iscontinually updated and enhanced, and fully supported as it evolves. With many courses, it�s just set and forget. But not with this one! We�ve got aPROVEN track record of continually updating and adding new content. An example is Tim's Java Masterclass course which now has hours of content and counting, and benefited a whopping0,000 students. And if you have any doubts about the course, be blown away by the glowing reviews left by students on this page. What else will you learn? You will learn how Android works at a deep level. Many courses show you how to create Android apps, allowing you to follow along clicking buttons but not really understanding what it happening. To become a successful Android app developer, you need to understand why you are clicking that button, and how the Android operating system works and how the Android SDK and Framework works. If you truly understand how something works, it means you can produce better quality apps, that have fewer bugs. We don't promise that you are going to write a Facebook or Instagram clone app in this course Courses that say they are going to teach you to create apps like that show apps with only the smallest amount of functionality, and usually don't explain anything in detail. There is no point going through Android training unless you can take that training and apply it into your own apps. his course is designed for you to follow along, but then to apply the information you have learned into your own apps. our instructors are me, Tim Buchalka and Jean-Paul Roberts. Between them theyhave a collective years of commercial software development experience,meaning you�re learning the right way to program to maximize your future development potential. Here�s what�s important. There�re a lot of people teaching Android development who are not developers. We�re developers with many years� experience with the Android platform, who also teach Android.

MVVM in WPF Survival Guide From A to Z,https://www.udemy.com/course/mvvm-in-wpf-survival-guide-from-a-to-z/,4.0,3,Engineer Spock,,,You should already have a decent C# and a little bit of WPF experience.,Logically and physically structuring WPF applications according to MVVM pattern. Apply either View-First or ViewModel-First approach. Set up Design-Time Data. Build a communication bridge between Views and ViewModels. Correctly apply a static message bus. Organize navigation. Validate Models. Build your own MVVM framework.,"MVVM (stands for Model-View-ViewModel) is a well-known architectural pattern in the world of WPF. Most enterprise level WPF applications are MVVM-based. Learn deeply the concepts lying behind the MVVM pattern in order to understand what MVVM is in essence and how to pragmatically apply it to a WPF application. This is a great MVVM tutorial for beginners (beginners in MVVM, don't forget to look at prerequisites)! Teaching Approach. No fluff, no ranting, no beating the air. I respect your time. The course material is succinct, yet comprehensive. All important concepts are covered. Particularly important topics are covered in-depth. on't forget that this course has English subtitles, so if you don't understand my accent, feel free to turn them on. Take this course and you will be satisfied. Build a strong foundation in applying MVVM with this course. In the case you�re just familiar with the WPF framework, learning this course will give you a level-up since you�ll be capable of developing professional WPF applications. Applying MVVM intelligently is a �must have� skill for WPF developers. If you are an experienced WPF developer, you might be interested in how MVVM frameworks may work under the hood. Throughout the course, we will be building a small MVVM framework similar to Caliburn. icro. Content and Overview. This course is primarily aimed at intermediate developers. Experts may also find interesting MVVM tricks provided in this course. If you are a beginner, be sure you�re ready to take this course, since it requires from you a solid C#-background and acquaintance with WPF. This course provides solid theoretical base reinforced by tons of practical material. This course is very practical (except the very first introductory module). �MVVM in WPF� is a very wide topic and it�s hardly possible to cover all the related challenges arising while applying MVVM. That�s why this course includes the most important topics understanding of which is a key for successful development. We will sacrifice some topics which may be interesting for students, but which are hardly connected with MVVM directly. What I�m talking about is, for example, the problem of setting up a full-fledged data access layer. Such topics are omitted. The most beneficial aspect of this course is that it gives you the deep understanding of the MVVM pattern. For example, you�ll see how to pass parameters to ViewModels through constructors, without using a static message bus, or passing parameters by explicitly setting properties of a ViewModel. In short, the course covers the following topics: MVVM background: what is MVVM, why to use it, when to use MVVM etc. Connecting Views and ViewModels: View-First and ViewModel-First approaches. Design-Time data support. Configuring and using an IoC-container. (by the example of Castle. indsor. Communication channel between Views and ViewModels: commands, attached and blend behaviors, static message bus (EventAggregator). Navigation: hierarchical UI composition, how to open dialogs, including modal dialogs, navigating to parameterized ViewModels (pass parameters into their constructors). Models and validation. MVVM toolkits: Caliburn. icro more closely. Unit-Testing of ViewModels. In the end, we will recap what you have learned and you will try to understand where you have to go further with the intention to master your skills. Here we will have a discussion of different paths you can go on. Keywords related to the course: MVVM inWPF. MVVM tutorial. MVVM pattern. Model-View-ViewModel MVVM tutorial. Caliburn. icro.

Web based software solutions are helping organizations keep up with their daily projects. A number of organizations are not there yet due to the cost of implementation. But in this course, we are going to see how easy it is to actually design, develop and deploy a complete and comprehensive monitoring and evaluation software system. Paper-based monitoring and evaluation process have a number of limitations, although they are very easy to create and organizations already have the skills and tools they need to create them. They don�t deliver as at when due. Besides the Paper-based solution, the use of MS Excel has also been adopted and is widely used by development professionals. As a result, it�s easy for them to dive straight in without extra training. As earlier mentioned, there are clear visible problems with these methods. Capturing data on paper and then collating various spreadsheets is time consuming and prone to error. Managers also don�t have clear oversight into what is happening in real-time. Monitoring and Evaluation indicators are only available after all the data has been entered, compiled and analyzed. This means that if there are any issues, management might not realize until they receive amonthly report. It also means that decisions will be made bymanagement based on outdated data. But with the web based monitoring and evaluation solution, the reverse will be the case. Organizations will be able to. Collect their project monitoring data as close to source as possible. Access real-time updates on specific projects, review and criticize incorrect data entries. View overall and specific project summaries using dashboard charts and tables. �Convert an entire report with dashboard charts and tables to PDF with a single click of a button. Feedback useful information to staff, in a timely manner. Enable management to make decisions in real time. Reduce cost on project field visits. Reduce cost on overall staff manpower. Increase project transparency and visibility. Increase trust and accountability.

Become an expert in reporting defects.,"This is another award winning and popular course from us and we are showcasing it on Udemy for the first time. Quality Assurance is a must need in today's era of technology. Meeting the expected quality of an application has become an essential factor for organizations. This is where software development and software testing concepts come into play. Organizations need to follow certain quality assurance standards in order to survive in the market competition. It is must required to understand software development life cycle before executing software testing concepts. We often ignore software testing fundamentals and manual testing concepts which is hugely harmful. IT professionals can never reach the expected level of success without a strong foundation in software development and software testing concepts. Also, it has not been easy to find project oriented and real-time training in software testing fundamentals. However, we all need to learn the basics of quality assurance and testing before jumping into any sort of automation. In this course, we took a hands-on and step by step approach to make it easier for IT professionals to master software testing core concepts. This course includes basic and advanced QA training videos with practical examples of different aspects of testing including software development life cycle (SDLC), overview of specific roles and real-time work environment for a software tester, different types of testing, creating comprehensive test plans, and test cases. JIRA is the tracker for teams planning and building great products. Thousands of teams choose JIRA to capture and organize issues, assign work, and follow team activity.

Test the relevance of each requirement to ensure that it is in scope for your project. Create and maintain a question file to reduce the impact of incorrect assumptions. Minimize the risk of scope creep caused by missed requirements. Confirm that each audience shares a common understanding of the requirements. Use our Peer Perception technique to find ambiguous words and phrases that can lead to misunderstandings. Applysimple rules to create technology-independent, component-focused requirements. Reduce the ambiguity of a statement by adding context and using standard terms and phrases.","Effective Requirements Reduce Project Failures. Writing requirements is one of the core competencies for anyone in an organization responsible for defining future Information Technology (IT) applications. However, nearly every independently executed root-cause analysis of IT project problems and failures in the past half-century have identified ""misunderstood or incomplete requirements"" as the primary cause. This has made writing requirements the bane of many projects. The real problem is the subtle differences between ""understanding"" someone else�s requirement and ""sharing a common understanding"" with the author. ""Writing Requirements for IT �Simply Put! "" gives you a set ofsimple rules that will make your requirement statements more easily understood by all target audiences. The focus is to increase the ""common understanding"" between the author of a requirement and the solution providers (e.  in-house or outsourced IT designers, developers, analysts, and vendors). The rules we present in this book will reduce the failure rate of projects suffering from poor requirements. Regardless of your job title or role, if you are tasked with communicating your future needs to others, this course is for you. How to Get the Most Out of this Course? To maximize the learning effect, you will have optional, online exercises to assess your understanding of each presented technique. Lessons prefaced with the phrase �Exercise� contain an exercise that we have prepared to give you an opportunity to try the presented technique yourself. These exercises are optional and they do not �test� your knowledge in the conventional sense. Their purpose is to demonstrate the use of the technique more real-life than our explanations can supply.

Rust  Basics,Connect JavaScript and Rust with WebAssembly. Game Development Basics. Practical Applications of Vectors.,"In this course, we will build a Snake Game with Rust, JavaScript, and WebAssembly. We will learn how to export API implemented with Rust to JavaScript app. We will get to know canvas rendering, applications of vectors, and basics of game development so that at the end of the course, you can take the core of this project and improve it or create your game. Before we start writing code, we need to have a clear vision of what we are going to build. Let's first decide on what features the game will have and how it will look like so that we can make a plan of action. We are going to build a classic snake game that you can see on the screen. When the snake eats food, it becomes longer, and the score increases. If the snake heats the wall or bites the tail game is over. Additionally, we will allow the player to stop the game by pressing the space button. To keep the user motivated, we will save the best score and show it alongside the current one. We make sure that the game looks good on any screen size, be it a tiny mobile phone or a large TV. We want each component of the game to be as independent as possible. We will implement the core logic of the game with Rust and will export API to JavaScript via WebAssembly. The main thing that we will export from Rust is Game. struct with a constructor and two public methods. The first method will receive a duration from the last update and direction that the user wants a snake to take. The second method will check if the game is over. On the JavaScript side, we will run the game loop, call API methods, render all game elements, capture user input, and save the best score. Now let's plan how we are going to make it all happen. First, we will install the tools needed for development and start the project. Then we will create an instance of the Game struct from JavaScript. Next, we will render all the objects of the game. Then we will implement logic to place food in a random place that is free from the snake. After that, we will start the game loop and make the snake move. Next, we will allow the user to control the snake direction and stop the game. After that, we will make that every time the snake eats the food, its tail grows longer. Finally, we will complete the development of the game by adding logic that will restart the game when the player lost and deploy the game. All the source code you can find in the repository. Each part will have a link to the corresponding commit. There are a lot of things to cover in this short course, so let's jump in.",,Web Development,,-1.0,English,,game development,,,webassembly,"build a snake game, create your game, export api implemented",udemy,www.udemy.com,,,,,

You are going to learn every bit of python language in this course so that you can apply your knowledge in real world apps. You will learn: Android game and app development with Kivy+Python. Python basics and advance. Important pygame module. Questions that most beginners ask me: Is Python A Good First Programming Language To Learn? Even though it has not yet been adopted as a first language by many computer science programs, Python is widely seen by industry experts as a great first programming language when learning to code and its extensive use in SpaceX to automate and handle technologies to launch rockets, Instagram, Google to support their backends and Many companies to support and execute ML and Deep Learning Algorithms; Its undoubtedly No. Programming Language to learn. For starters, the syntax of Python is simpler than that of most other major programming languages, with fewer exceptions and special cases. It also tends to use plain English keywords in place of the system of punctuation that has to be memorized in other languages, making it easier to learn to code. Given these conventions, Python code tends to appear as less of a ""jumble"" to newcomers than it does in comparable languages. Another great feature of Python is the ubiquity of its use. While Python is optimized for development on Linux and Unix systems, interpreters are available for just about every major operating system. All implementations of Python are supported by an excellent standard library, which means that new students can very quickly move on to creating actual functional programs that are useful. Additionally, the standard implementation of Python, CPython, is free and open source. What Type Of Jobs Are Available To Python Programmers? In the job market, if you observe the trends; Python is often looked as a strong language to support some primary language that is more broadly used like C or Java. But Lately, with the evolution of ML and Deep Learning Algorithms; it is highly demanded skill to have in18 and later. There are a variety of jobs that one can get focusing exclusively on Python development, however. Many of these jobs will be in building and improving the internal tools that a company uses to create its finished marketable products, rather than working on the finished product itself. One specific economic sector where the presence of Python programming is particularly strong is the geospatial industry. This is a critical industry that deals in navigational tools such as GPS, radar and light measurements. If you're interested in web applications, Python is a better choice for development (working with the back-end or server side) rather than design (creating the actual finished front-end that site visitors interact with). As mentioned previously, Google employed Python for many components of its search engine, and it is quite widely used in the data mining industry. Finally, Python can also be used for game development. Some famous examples of games developed either entirely or in large part with Python include EVE Online, Civilization IV, the Battlefield game series and the Mount and Blade games. The popular development environment Blender is written in Python. TOPICS TO BE COVERED IN THIS COURSE: Installing Python. Running Python Code. Strings. Lists. Dictionaries. Tuples. Sets.

Build Virtual Reality Games for Android and iPhone,https://www.udemy.com/course/build-virtual-reality-games-for-android-and-iphone/,3.6,862,Yohann Taieb,,,a little knowledge of Unity helps. own a MAC OS or Windows PC or Linux,quickly build and release Virtual Reality games for Android and iPhones. Take existing games and turn them into Virtual Reality ones. Create VR waypoints for people who only own the headset device.,"By now everyone has heard about Virtual Reality games. We are at the beginning of a new era where people are immersed into virtual worlds and they get to be or do anything they wish. Now is the time to start making virtual reality games. This is what this course will teach you. Whether you have no experience making games with Unity or you are a seasoned developer, this course will get you up and running in no time. You will be shown how to start making VR games from scratch and publish them in the Apple app store and Google Play store. All steps are shown to you so you have all the chances to succeed. By the way, this course is also meant for people that already have existing Unity projects and would like to quickly turn them into VR games. The future of gaming is exciting thanks to Virtual Reality. Don't be left behind. Join us now. Important: This course is part of a the world's one and one series on Unity professional multiplayer games. The content is so big, it couldn't fit in one course. Here is the courses are split in key areas: There are so many tutorials, guides and courses out there, that it�s hard to know how to start learning how to code, game development, and even harder to know in which order you should take the courses. We�ve decided to focus on Unity rather than other platforms because the team behind Unity has a great vision. They are always on top of things. Each time a new device comes out, they add support for it and also create special libraries for it. We believe you should focus on Unity as well. We want to make sure you do by providing you the best learning material at the best prices. For example, Oculus Rift and Samsung VR are fully operational on Unity Unity also entered the live cinematic world (animated movies, think Toy Story). The future is bright for Unity developers. (more about the future of Unity ). There�s also been a change in the mobile app app store category ranking system which makes it harder to get app exposure for new apps. It means developers need to focus on a few apps instead of bombarding the app store with reskins. Nowadays, an app is a continuous work of art where developers need to listen to the users and keep updating the app to give them exactly what they want. Having said that, you will maximize your learning experience if you takes the courses in the following order: Understand the process of making games: Before even getting started into developing, you need to understand the whole process of making games, from A to Z. Take the �Captain Rocket. � course where you get to see how a Unity project gets reused and turned into another game and gets published to iTunes app store. course: Publish Captain RocketiPhone game underhours, Unity Learn the basics: The course �Begin Unity Programming. � is short (about minutes) and entertaining where you will learn keys Unity concepts and code using Star Wars figurines. Another important course is �Fundamentals of Programming. �. Beware! This course goes over the hard stuff of programming. It�s explaining the mechanics used in programming, just like you would get in a computer science class in the American Ivy league Universities. It�s not for everyone, but it should be taken by EVERYONE. You need to understand what are for / while loops, what�s the difference between an int, a float or a double, and what are the principles of object oriented programming (to name a few key concept). The course comes with plenty of mind-stimulating exercises made with the new elegant language named Swift. Get comfortable with using Unity�s user interface: course ""Introduction to Game Development with Unity. Unity Editor can be overwhelming at first with all its windows, sub windows and tabs. Luckily, this course guides you through it. Oh, i forgot to mention, it�s free! Learn how to create graphics to use in your game: ""3D Pixel Art for non artist. Crossy Road Modeling. Unity. Graphic assets can be illustrations, graphics, sprites, voxel art (MineCraft like) or also sound effects and Unity bundles. I recommend to start making graphic assets following the course �3D Pixel Art for non artist. Crossy Road Modeling. Unity. Why? Because it�s a course that allows anyone to make decent game graphics without having to be an artist! With the correct tools and the right guidance, you will end up making pixel graphics (voxel) art just like Crossy road or MineCraft by the end of the day. Once you know how to create assets, it�s time you learn how to make characters, animate them, and import them into Unity to use them! You will learn all of the above in the course named �3D Pixel Characters Modeling and Animations for all. Unity. By the way, the tools used in the course are all free to use, that�s the cherry on the cake! By the end of the course, you will be able to create and animate characters like Spiderman, Ironman and wonder woman. Make Ironman dance hip-hop is hilarious and gratifying! Learn core Unity development: At this point, you must be antsy to create a game. Contrary to most online courses, the following course allow you to create and also PUBLISH the game you�re making to the Google Play store and the iTune app store. Take the �Unity16 � Build, program and publish Crossy Road game. � course. Learn about key concepts, must-have scripts to get a professional game like Crossy Road and get it out the door into the wilderness of the app stores! I can�t stress enough the joy of having your game out in the app store where all your friends and family are amazed by you owning a piece of the app stores! (scoring social points!). Now that you�ve got your first game in the app store, you should learn how to make more complex games, that are using animations, physics, vehicles, shooting, and character Artificial Intelligence. The perfect course for these topics is �Unity16 � Build , program and publish a shooter game. Enhance your game development skills: It�s time to learn specific game mechanics that will improve the player�s game experience and ultimately get more user engagement. You need to know how to add multiplayer to your game. A game that�s using the multiplayer mechanics is a more demanded type of game because players prefer to play against / with other players rather than computer simulated AI (Artificial Intelligence). The course �Unity Multiplayer16 � Build Online Shooter � code included. � is the perfect way to turn the game you�ve learned how to make (the shooter game) into a multiplayer game. Contrary to most courses, you�re not wasting time on creating code to make the game, but you will be focusing on jumping straight into the multiplayer functionality. This is a must-have course and one that I am the most proud of because �multiplayer� is a hard concept and I finally got to find the simplest way so that anyone can add multiplayer to any Unity games. Equipping characters with weapons, gears and trinkets. The majority of multiplayer games allow players to pickup items, find treasures and get loot from bosses. Now the hard part for the game developer is to know how to pickup these items, equip these items, remove them, swap them. And all of this needs to be done in multiplayer,� meaning, when a player equip a new item such as a sword or a helmet, all other players need to see that new state. Not so easy at all� That�s why this course is a must: ""Unity16 Character gear and weapon use. Inventory system for single player and multiplayer games: unity-inventory-system-for-games-multiplayer-online. Now that you understand how to pickup items and equip them, you need an inventory system to keep track of which item the player owns. Many games call this a stash or a backpack. It sounds simple to implement, but it�s tough, especially in multiplayer games. Oh, almost forgot to mention, the user interface needs to work on all screen sizes, small screens like Android phones and iPhones, as well as big TV screens for PCs. This course will teach you every single details. And yes, the code is included! ""UnityInventory System for Professional Games. Item attributes and statistics. Before you can get into player fighting, dueling and combat, you need to setup stats and attributes on each items and players. For example, swords have a specific strength, intelligence, dexterity, mana cost and other skills. This course teaches you how to set these attributes up and how to use them during combat to compute what�s the damage taken or mitigated. It�s also great to create character leveling and experience gaining. ""Unity16 RPG Character Stats and Item Attributes System. Mastering Melee and Ranged weapon mechanics. A good game needs melee weapons such as swords, knives, or axes, and also needs ranged weapons such as guns, bows with arrows and such. Learn the mechanics and get to apply them hands-on with the source code that comes with the course. range-and-melee-weapons-course-unity. ""Unitypro multiplayer combat using melee and ranged weapons. Turn your game dev into a game business: It�s fun to make games but it�s even more fun when games bring in money. No seriously, if you plan on just making games for fun, that�s fine, but many of you would love to turn this hobby into a business so that you can keep doing what you love without having to go find another job to pay the bills. So how can you monetize your game? Add advertising banners and full screen ads. The course �Unity16 � Build, program and publish Crossy Road gam. e� has an advanced section on how to integrate Unity ads to your game. This is a good start but it�s not enough, you need to add a video reward system where players have to watch a second video advertisement to get virtual coins in return. Each time a player watches a video, you get a few cents to a couple dollars, especially if the player downloads and opens the app from the advertisement! Now, that�s what we call potentially good income! The developer from Crossy Road used this exact same system and made a couple million dollars in a week or so. Now I�m not saying this is going to happen to you, but do you really need this much money to keep you going? Unity Game Boost: Build a Video Reward System (bring in $$$). Another way to monetize a game is to use virtual coin systems where players can earn, buy and use coins to get virtual items and goods. The player will buy virtual coins with real money using the in-app purchase in-game store. There is a course just for that: �Unity Game Boost: Coin Management System. �. The course drive you through every single step to create the virtual coin system and store/ retrieve the player�s coin amount. Then you get to create an in-game store so that player can buy virtual good with real money. The beauty of this course is that you learn how to bundle the coin system so that you can reuse it in every game you make in no time. A must-have course! Listen to this scenario, it�s the most common one for game developers: You�ve made a decent game, you published it, you get a couple hundred downloads and then �dead silence�. You can keep praying the Gods for help or you can help yourself and add Unity Analytics to your game. Thanks to analytics, you get a report on key metrics in a nice online dashboard. You get answers to key questions. such as. Is my game to hard r too easy? Which level has the most players quit? Which character gets selected the most? How many times a level gets played? Take the course ""Unity Game Analytics. Once you have all these questions answered, you modify your game to fit the player�s feedback, it�s time to understand how to add fun stuff using physics mechanics. The perfect course for this is �Unity Game Physics. Remember, it takes time and experience to get to understand how to read your audience and know what they want. It�s great to get real data from your players and analyze them. Data scientists are in high demand. Some game companies are really good at this and came up with a p behavioral system that forces players to have the desire to spend money in the game. Critics like Nick Saint of Business Insider have said that Zynga�s games have essentially the same mechanics even though they have different premises and settings. You also need to create an audience so that each time you create a new game or add a new level or feature to an existing game, you need to be able to tell people about it. That�s why you need to build an email list. The email list is platform agnostic, meaning, no matter what happens tomorrow, even if the iPhone industry dies, you still have an email list of people who love to play your game genres, and they will gladly follow you to any platforms, whether you decided to create Virtual Reality games, ebooks or movies! The course �Unity16 � Email List Building � Why and How. � will help you integrate the email capture system into your game and help you build your email list. Email list building with Unity. The marketing side of things. Disclaimer: Would you rather take the time to market your game or start making another game? We all rather keep making games than marketing the games we�ve already made and that�s totally understandable. Making games is fun and gratifying. Marketing games is not sexy, nobody wants to have to bother people and tell them about your game. After all, shouldn�t your game be good enough that it speaks for itself? not in today�s world. Publishing a game is just the beginning, creating the buzz around it, baking viral mechanics into it, getting featured in magazines and media is a must. The course �Become a Mobile App Growth Hacker. Total Theory and Training. � teaches you fundamentals concepts on how to use marketing even before you�ve created your game. Making a game is great, making a game that brings in revenue is great, and making a game that the whole world enjoys is even better! Chat system: Players want to interact with eachother. Online games need chat systems to allow players to send messages to eachother. The messages need to be stored in your own private server (online or local). This course will teach you just that. Beware! This course uses advanced topics like MySQL, PHP, and Apache. The good news is that all the source codes are included so you just have to use them and customize them to make it original to your taste. Take this course ""UnityBuild a chat system for online multiplayer games. in-game mail message system. This course goes hand in hand with the course above(chat system). If somehow one of the player is not online at the moment, other players can send in-game emails. A must-have for online multiplayers. ""UnityMultiplayer InGame Mail Messaging. Maths for Game Developers: okay, let�s be honest, making games is sexy, learning the maths not so much. But don�t you want to understand the math behind the game mechanics? Take this somewhat boring but necessary course: ""Maths for Video Games. You don�t have time or don�t want to spend too much money on graphics? Me either.. That�s why the following course automatically generate environments, dungeons, castles, houses, weapons and entire worlds for you! Neat? very powerful stuff.

Manage logins and server roles, and import and export data. Implement and maintain indexes, and manage and configure databases, including compression and concurrency problems. Manage SQL Server Agent and audit SQL Server instances. Collect and analyse troubleshooting data. Plan and install SQL Server and related services, including implementing a migration strategy.","Please note:Microsoft has withdrawn the-462 exam. However, the information in this course is still relevant to DBA. Do you want to gain practical experience in Database Administration in SQLServer?Welcome. In this course, learn some of the skills that Microsoft want you to know, and add another tool to your CV or resume, and even go for the official Microsoft certification. SQLServer is one of the main database tools that is requested in the job market, and the ability to being able to do DBA for SQLServer could be very useful for your current work, and your next job hunt. We'll download and install for free SQLServer Developer, which gives you all of the capabilities of the full-cost Enterprise edition (though without being able to use it for commercial purposes). We'll start by downloading a demonstration database, and learning how to backup and restore this database, and what recovery models are appropriate for other databases, to enable you to offer Point in Time recovery. We'll manage logins and server roles, so you can control who gets access to what data, implement and maintain indexes, so you can speed up searches, and import and export data. We'll look at managing SQLServer Agent, so you can automate routine tasks, and also be alerted to problems, we'll manage and configure databases, and look at compression, both of which aids with administrating big databases. And much more. The course will take around hours to complete,but completing this will enable you to versed in Database Administration tasks, giving you hands-on experience. The course increases in difficulty slowly, so you'll manually backup a database, but then later we'll use SQLServer Agent to automate this. In this course, we will only do activities that require one computer, instead of multiple servers or virtualization. The course is fairly relaxed there will be a few ""wrong turns"", so you can see what problems might arise, but every lesson works towards an end goal at a relatively slow pace, so you can follow on your own computer easily. I assume that you know how to use a computer, including installing programs, but the actual DBA will be at a basic level, and I'll introduce every component as we go on. No knowledge of T-SQLis required, as I'll demonstrate everything Ican through the GUI(Graphical User Interface) as well as T-SQL. However, if you are going to go for the official Microsoft exam, the equivalent knowledge as per my first two courses in-461 T-SQL is essential. At the end of the course, you can download a certificate of completion, so you can show everyone your new-found skills, and continue your preparations for the official Microsoft certifications.

Create data visualization with Power BI. Create data visualization with Tableau.,"Business intelligence (BI) helps organizations analyse historical and current data, so they can quickly uncover actionable insights for making strategic decisions. Business intelligence tools make this possible by processing large data sets across multiple sources and presenting findings in visual formats that are easy to understand and share. Business intelligence systems combine data gathering, data storage, and knowledge management with data analysis to evaluate and transform complex data into meaningful, actionable information, which can be used to support more effective strategic, tactical, and operational insights and decision-making. Business intelligence environments consist of a variety of technologies, applications, processes, strategies, products, and technical architectures used to enable the collection, analysis, presentation, and dissemination of internal and external business information. How business intelligence works. There are four keys steps that business intelligence follows to transform raw data into easy-to-digest insights for everyone in the organization to use. The first three�data collection, analysis, and visualization�set the stage for the final decision-making step. Before using BI, businesses had to do much of their analysis manually, but BI tools automate many of the processes and save companies time and effort. Step Collect and transform data from multiple sources. Business intelligence tools typically use the extract, transform, and load (ETL) method to aggregate structured and unstructured data from multiple sources. This data is then transformed and remodelled before being stored in a central location, so applications can easily analyse and query it as one comprehensive data set. Step Uncover trends and inconsistencies. Data mining, or data discovery, typically uses automation to quickly analyse data to find patterns and outliers which provide insight into the current state of business. BI tools often feature several types of data modelling and analytics�including exploratory, descriptive, statistical, and predictive�that further explore data, predict trends, and make recommendations. Step Use data visualization to present findings. Business intelligence reporting uses data visualizations to make findings easier to understand and share. Reporting methods include interactive data dashboards, charts, graphs, and maps that help users see what�s going on in the business right now. Step Take action on insights in real time. Viewing current and historical data in context with business activities gives companies the ability to quickly move from insights to action. Business intelligence enables real time adjustments and long-term strategic changes that eliminate inefficiencies, adapt to market shifts, correct supply problems, and solve customer issues. Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your. unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet. or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources. visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want. Power BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics: A Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop. An online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service. Power BI mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices. Tableau is a data visualization and business intelligence tool used for reporting and analysing vast volumes of data.

Visual Studio 2015 Installed,At the end of the course you'll be able to take what you've learned and the code I've provided to completely automate tuning a production SQL Server instance. The students will have a solid understanding of how the process of performance tuning at the instance level works.,"Recent Reviews: ""Mike has given a great template that will allow DBAs to ease their admin tasks. Really well done. -Doug Alderson. ""This is a great tool to help DBAs and nondatabase system administrator for performance fine tuning"" -Bernard Bernard. Welcome to Building an Automated SQL Server Performance Tuning Engine. In this course, we are going to build a completely automated application for tuning a SQL Server instance. The application has been running on live production instances. for several years. These SQL Servers have needed no performance tuning attention. since the tool was installed. I�ve created the software and named it SQL Black Box. I choose the name because for most in the organization the inner workings of the tool will be a black box. The software in the course will be written in C. and the SQL Server code will obviously be transact-sql. This is not a step by step on how I authored the code. This course assembles the sundry components that make up the application. You�ll be able to take the application. and install it on any SQL Server you want. You won�t be able to resale. any portion of the code but that�s the only restriction. Regardless of your skill level this application will ease your administrative burden. Advanced students will be able to choose what modules they want to implement. I use the term module. within the software to denote individual unit of work. For example, there will be a module. that removes exact duplicates. and there will be a module that adds high impact indexes to the instance. Please note I used the word instance. and not databases. We don�t tune databases; we tune the instance. they are on because all the critical resources are shared at that level. Those students newer to SQLServer. will be able to change a couple of lines of code, build the modules and then use task scheduler to automated their schedules.

Amazon's cloud is called AWS which stands for Amazon Web Services. and their database offering is called RDS or Relational Database Service. Before WE. get started I would like to share MY excitement on co-authoring my first course. I will be working with noted cloud expert Ryan Kroonenburg. This is the first course I'm co-authoring and couldn't be more excited about working with author and AWS Could Architect Ryan Kroonenburg. Ryan's been teaching AWS centric courses on Udemy for quite some time and his courses are the most highly rated AWS courses available. HOW. is this course different from my course titled How To. Become a SQL Server Cloud Architect on AWS? This course is more focused on MIGRATING your on premise databases to RDS. We will be solely focused on RDS and walk through several migration and post migration STRATEGIES. This course is NOT for any of the current AWS certifications. Currently, there are NO database specific certifications for Amazon's RDS platform. This course WILL give you the skills necessary to move SQL Server Database to Amazon's cloud. The course will provide YOU with REAL WORLD examples on how to MOVE your existing database to the cloud. Amazon's control% of the cloud market and is spending approximately a BILLION a year on cementing that lead over it's closest competition, which is Microsoft Azure. Currently, Azure comes in second at. As a SQL Server Consultant I can tell you that many of my customers are MOVING to Amazon's various cloud offerings. There are still many LIMITATIONS and nuances to moving SQL Server Databases to the cloud. We will discuss many of these in the course. The code, applications, and TOOLS (like Management Studio) you already use today with your existing databases can be used with Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS AUTOMATICALLY patches the database software and backs up your database, storing the backups for a user-defined retention period and enabling point-in-time recovery. Amazon RDS makes it easy to use replication to enhance availability and reliability for production workloads. Using the Multi-AZ deployment option you can run MISSION CRITICAL workloads with high availability and built-in automated fail-over from your primary database to a synchronously replicated secondary database in case of a failure.

Memorize the terms given in each video as well as any design techniques, such as using atomic values, the definition of 1NF, etc.  . You will need tools that allow you to practice designing databases. This could be anything from a pen and paper to premium software. This course will be using a large chalkboard for the first half of the course and then free design software later on. Just know that you will not be required to pay for any design tools!. Read any supplementary material provided and attempt to memorize the content and apply it to what you already know. Be CREATIVE! Database design is not only a technical skill, but it is also an art! This course will teach you the technical aspects of design as well as the artistic side. Be determined.  Database design can be a daunting task.  It's scary, but easy once you get the hang of things","Learn the definition of relations, tuples, attributes, and over one hundred other vocabulary words! Learn all of the types of relationships and how to properly design them all within a database. This includes one to one, one to many, and many to many. You will also learn about the difference between a parent table and a child table. Learn about all of the types and categories of keys including superykeys, candidate keys, primary keys, alternate keys, natural keys, surrogate keys, simple keys, compound keys, composite keys, and foreign keys. Learn database normalization. We will be learning the firstnormal forms of database normalization. This will reduce redundant and incorrect data as well as protect our database integrity. Learn about data, data types, foreign key constraints, and other important concepts used to create the best database. Learn to design a database from beginning to end!","Whichever database application you use does not matter! This course will cover design concepts for all relational database management systems. This course is designed for those who want to download this course or watch it ad free. This is a course for relational database design. Here are some examples of the most popular databases: MySQL. Oracle. Microsoft SQL Server. PostgreSQL. SQLite. MiariaDB. and MORE! We start off this course by taking our time to first look at what a database is and how it differs from a spreadsheet, website, filing cabinet, and so forth. We introduce SQL and talk about data definition language and data manipulation language. After aboutsolid videos of explaining databases and SQL, we dive into learning about entities and attributes. We apply all of these concepts to structure tables and relationships. We learn to design all of the relationships and I explain everything in depth. Most of the videos are on my chalkboard, explaining concepts. This is because it helps to fully understand database design before you dive into designing your own database. Once we go over all of the concepts of database design we will be designing databases from start to finish. No programming skills are required. This course does not program a database. This course will only be teaching how to best design your database. You may be wondering why such a large course is required for only designing a database. Well, designing a database is an extremely important part of database management. The best design will get us the best results and make programming our database really easy. After this course you should be able to tackle almost any database design project with confidence and skill. Keep in mind though that learning database design takes a lot of time and effort.

Fundamental Concepts for Scaling and Replication in PostgreSQL.,"PostgreSQL is one of the most powerful and easy-to-use database management systems. It has strong support from the community and is being actively developed with a new release every year. PostgreSQL supports the most advanced features included in SQL standards. It also provides NoSQL capabilities and very rich data types and extensions. All of this makes PostgreSQL a very attractive solution in software systems. However, getting the best performance from it has not been an easy subject to tackle. You need just the right combination of rules of thumb to get started, proper testing, solid monitoring, and maintenance to keep your system running well, and hints for add-on tools to add the features the core database doesn't try to handle on its own. This Udemy course is structured to give you both the theoretical and practical aspects to implement a High-Performance Postgres. It will help you build dynamic database solutions for enterprise applications using one of the latest releases of. PostgreSQL. You'll examine all the advanced aspects of PostgreSQL. in detail, including logical replication, database clusters, performance tuning, and monitoring. You will also work with the PostgreSQL optimizer, configure Postgres for high speed by looking at transactions, locking, indexes, and optimizing queries. You are expected to have some exposure to databases. Basic familiarity with database objects such as tables and indexes is expected. You will find this Udemy course really useful if you have no or a little exposure to PostgreSQL. If you have been working with PostgreSQL for a few years, you should still find a few useful commands that you were not aware of or a couple of optimization approaches you have not tried. You will also gain more insight into how the database works. PostgreSQL Performance Tuning Online Course Curriculum: Understanding PostgreSQL Server Architecture. In this section, we will explore the PostgreSQL Architecture. Shared Buffers works in cooperation with operating system cache, rather than replacing it. These caches improve performance by reducing the physical I/O necessary. Why we need to set Checkpoints carefully to limit crash recovery time, while not impacting the rest of the system's performance. This section will give you all an introduction to why we need the WAL Writer and also the Background Writer. See the stages that the Query Processor has to pass in order to obtain the results. The utility Subsystem provides ways to maintain the database, such as claiming storage, updating statistics and logging. Configuring Vacuum for Performance. We will understand why any time we do an UPDATE or DELETE, we will leave a dead row. behind (and potentially a dead index entry) that needs to be cleaned up later by some form of vacuum. We will learn that when tables grow very large because of excessive dead tuples then performance will tend to decrease. Therefore the VACUUM process should never be avoided. This section explains why it's better to have a steady low-intensity vacuum work, using the autovacuum feature of the database, instead of disabling that feature and having to do that cleanup in larger blocks. How to use an Index efficiently. Understand that adding an index increase overhead every time you add or change rows in a table. Each index needs to satisfy enough queries to justify how much it costs to maintain. In this section, we'll explain why the execution plan of a query depends on the data inside the table. If the data has low carnality, PostgreSQL will most probably ignore the index. In this section we'll learn why an index is only useful if it is selective. ; it can be used to only return a small portion of the rows in a table. In this section, we will explore how to use bitmap scans. effectively. Index Optimization Tips. On top of just using indexes, it is also possible to implement custom strategies for your particular application to speed things up. How to be able to answer queries by only using the data in an index using covering indexes. This section covers why defining indexes on foreign keys. it's a good practice. In this section, we will explore partial indexes and how small, efficient index can be enjoyed. Indexes can require periodic rebuilding to return them to optimum performance, and clustering the underlying data against the index order can also help improve their speed for queries. We'll explain when it's useful to modify the fill factor parameter of a table. In this section, we will see in which cases it's better to use a combined index vs multiple independent indexes. Making Use of Statistics. In this section, you'll explore statistics that can help you find and sort the queries that are responsible for most of the load on the system. PostgreSQL offers a large set of statistics. In this section, we'll make it easier to take advantage of their insights. We'll get to see the fastest way to detect missing indexes but we'll also explore when it's necessary to drop indexes. Spotting Query Problems. We'll explain how to read query plans and understand how each of the underlying node types works. We'll get to see how queries are executed as a series of nodes that each do a small task, such as fetching data aggregation or sorting. We'll explore portions of the query that actually had the longest execution time, and see if they had an appropriate matching cost. The variation between estimated and actual rows can cause major planning issues. We'll explore what we can do in such cases. Query Optimizations Tips. We'll see why it's important to first question the semantic correctness of a statement before attacking the performance problem. We'll understand why we should avoid SELECT , ORDER BY and DISTINCT unless we really need them and there is no other way. We'll explore PostgreSQL features such as CASE syntax and parallel queries to reduce time execution for queries. How to set sharedbuffers for better performance. We will see that the PostgreSQL allocation for the default sharedbuffers is extremely low and we need to increase it to allow proper shared memory size for the database. We will cover how sharedbuffers works in cooperation with operating system cache, rather than replacing it and we should size it as only a moderate percentage of total RAM. We will understand that if we want to do better than allocating a percentage to the sharedbuffers relative to the OS cache, we need to analyze the buffers cache content. Scaling and Replication. We'll see how replication can also be used to improve the performance of a software system by making it possible to distribute the load on several database servers. In some cases, the functionality of replication provided by PostgreSQL isn't enough. There are third-party solutions that work around PostgreSQL, providing extra features, such as Pgpool-II which can work as a load balancer and Postgres-XL which implements a multi-server distributed database solution that can operate very large amounts of data and handle a huge load.",,PostgreSQL,,-1.0,English,,"nosql, scaling and replication, query optimization, monitoring, performance tuning, database management systems, database clusters, logical replication",postgresql,,,"configure vacuum, use an index",udemy,www.udemy.com,"DATABASE,OBJECTS",LINUX,"LINUX,DATABASE",,"LINUX,DATABASE,DATABASE OBJECTS"

This is supposed to introduce students to many of the problems professionals in the field of data analytics and data modeling face on a daily basis. I will also introduce data management in relation to app development, where you will learn how to properly design a SQL database in xcode.","My hope is that through this class, I can share my love for data analytics with you guys, and also teach you things you would normally have to go to ayear college for. Almost every job in the world now relies on Data Analytics. Not only that, but companies will pay huge amounts of money for people with these skills, since it is still such a new market. While this course focuses on MySQL, I will be going over topics that extend into other realms of data analytics, going in depth into what it takes to properly manage a database, and how to analyze a database into meaningful results for a company. The course follows the following format: The first section is an introduction into what MySQL, with an installation of the software as well as the two free data models we will be working with extensively in this course. The next section is a high level overview of data, and database management. I make sure to touch on how data applies to all forms of software and uses, not just within MySQL. At the end will be a review covering the topics we learned, in a way that also tests your ability to apply the new concepts to conceptive questions. The following section will be going over all the basics of SQL, introducing all the topics right away so we can reuse and reapply the functionality over and over in the following sections in more complex queries. he questions at the end will give you a chance to reapply the section's materials in a meaningful way. The next section will be an introduction of relational databases, specifically them relationship. With this introduction, we will start going over more difficult concepts, slowly building on materials learned in previous sections. Again, this will feature a review quiz at the end, further solidifying all the material you have learned so far. In the many to many section, we will be covering a more advanced relational database, and introduce more MySQLtopics scattered throughout the section. As always, we will have a review lecture, and I will make sure to explain the process of data modeling and querying as we go along. In this section we will discuss the final relational modeling concepts,1 relationships and recursive relationships. This will push your understanding of data analytics from beginner to intermediate stages. Recursive relationships are the most difficult to master, so I will be spend a considerable amount of time going over the intricacies in the formulation of each data model. At the end, there will be another review section, which will provide you with another opportunity to go over the material. This section will be a wrap up of data modeling, and we will be going over some more complicated examples of model creation, as well as the rules and standards associated with this field. This review section is set up to test all the data modeling practices we have learned so far in a meaningful and challenging way. In this section, we will talk about Temporal and Spatial Databases, one of the newest and challenging concepts related to Data Analytics. We will go over how these topics are being used to reshape the database world, and go over some of the querying and data modeling techniques associated with them. We will have a review section, touching on the topics learned, as well as showing some conceptual questions related to these young database techniques. The final exam will be featured in this section, which will wrap up everything we have learned into final queries and data modeling examples that will test your knowledge, and give you a chance to see what areas you still need improvement in. This is the first of two bonus sections, introducing two real world database models you would design for clients in MySQL. The data model in this section is an NBA statistics App, called NBA Today, that we will use to model questions and queries faced by a similar mobile application that is available in the App Store. This will give us a chance to see how data analytics and data modeling is used to solve real world problems. The second bonus section is a business database model, in this instance, a prison system that we have been tasked with answering queries about that will introduce new querying topics and show what a business model will look like when we apply the lessons we have learned. We will build everything from scratch, and I will even show you how I created the dummy data using excel. I hope you guys are excited as I am to get into the world of Data Analytics and Database Management. Whether you are a student, trying to learn a new skill, or an entrepreneur, MySQL, and more importantly, data analyticsis an extremely important skill to have in today's world.

Welcome toAn Introduction to Machine Learning for Data Engineers. This course is part of my series for data engineering. The course is a prerequisite for my course titled Tensorflow on the Google Cloud Platform for DataEngineers. This course will show you the basics of machine learning for data engineers. The course is geared towards answering questions . for the Google Certified Data Engineering exam. This is NOT . a general course or introduction to machine learning. This is a very focused course.  for learning the concepts you'll need to know to pass the Google Certified Data Engineering Exam. At this juncture, theGoogle Certified Data Engineer. is the onlyreal world certification. for data and machine learning engineers. Machine learning. is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed.  The key part of that definition is �without being explicitly programmed.� . The vast majority of applied.  machine learning is supervised machine learning. The word applied.  means you build models in the real world. Supervised.  machine learning is a type of machine learning that involves building models from data that exists. A good way to think about supervised machine learning.  is:If you can get your data into a tabular format. , like that of an excel spreadsheet, then most machine learning models can model it. In the course. , we�ll learn the different types.  of algorithms . used. We will also cover the nomenclature . specific to machine learning. Every discipline has their own vernacular and data science is not different.  . You�ll also learn why the Python programming language.  has emerged as the gold standard for building real world machine learning models. Additionally, we will write a simple neural network.  and walk through.  the process and the code step by step. Understanding the code won't be as important as understanding the importance and effectiveness of one simple artificial neuron.                                *Five Reasons to take this Course.*.  . 1) You Want to be a Data Engineer.  . It's the number one job inthe world. (not just within the computer space)The growth potential career wise is second to none. You want the freedom to move anywhere you'd like. You want to be compensated for your efforts. You want to be able to work remotely. The list of benefits goes on. 2) The Google Certified Data Engineer.  . Google is always ahead of the game. If you were to look back at a timeline of their accomplishments in the data space you might believe they have a crystal ball. They've been a decade ahead of everyone. Now, they are the first and the only cloud vendor to have a data engineering certification. With their track record I'll go with Google. 3)The Growth of Data is Insane.  . Ninety percent of all the world's data has been created in the last two years. Business around the world generate approximately 450 billion transactions a day. The amount of data collected by all organizations is approximately 2.5 Exabytes a day. That number doubles every month. 4) Machine Learning in Plain English.  . Machine learning is one of the hottest careers on the planet and understanding the basics is required to attaining a job as a data engineer. Google expects data engineers to be able to build machine learning models. In this course, we will cover all the basics of machine learning at a very high level. 5) You want to be ahead of the Curve.  . The data engineer role is fairly new. While you�re learning, building your skills andbecoming certified you arealso the first to be part of this burgeoning field. You know that the first to be certified meansthe first to be hired and first to receive the top compensation package.

Understand how to create a serverless application in AWS. Learn how to secure access to data and resources. Run tests on your configuration and code. Create a highly available serverless microservice data API. Build, deploy and run your serverless configuration and code.","In the past few years, there has been a shift away from monolithic architecture (with for example its large centralized deployments) to microservice architectures with small independent deployments, allowing much more flexibility and agile delivery. Traditionally virtual machines and containers were the main options for deploying microservices but they involve a lot of operational effort, configuration, and maintenance. More recently, there has been a growing interest in Serverless computing due to the increase in developer productivity, built in auto-scaling abilities, and reduced operational costs. In combining both microservices and serverless computing, organizations will benefit from having the servers and capacity planning managed by the cloud provider, making them much easier to deploy and run at scale.In this course we show you how to build an end-to-end serverless application for your organization. We have selected a data API use case that could reduce costs and give you more flexibility in how you and your clients consume or present your application, metrics and insight data. We make use of the latest serverless deployment and build framework, share our experience on testing, and provide best practices for running a serverless stack in a production environment.

The knowledge builds . from course to course in a serial nature.  Without . the first course many students might struggle with this one. Thank you. Many new to machine learning believe.  machine learning engineers spend their days building deepneural models.  in Keras or SciKit-Learn. I hate to be the bearer.  of bad news but that isn�t the case.  . A recent study from Kaggle determined that 80%.  of time data scientists and machine learning engineersspend their time cleaning data.  The term used for cleaning data in data science.  circles is called data wrangling.  . In this course we are going tolearnPandas . using alab integrated approach. Programming is something you have todo. inorder to master it. Youcan't read about Python. and expect to learnit. Pandas.  is the single most important library.  for data wrangling.  in Python. Data wranglingis the process ofprogrammatically transforming data into a format that makes it easier to workwith. This might mean modifying all of the values in a given column.  in a certain way, or merging multiple columns . together. The necessity for data wrangling.  is often a byproduct of poorly collected or presented data. In the real world data is messy.  Very rarely . do you have nicely cleansed data sets . to point your supervised models against. Keep in mind that 99% of all applied machine learning.  (real world machine learning)is supervised. That simply means models need really clean, nicely formatted data. Bad data in means bad model resultsout.                              **Five Reasons to Take this Course**. 1) You Want to be a Machine Learning Engineer.

You want to be compensated for your efforts. You want to be able to work remotely. The list of benefits goes on. Without a solid understanding of data wrangling in Python you'll have a hard time of securing a position as a machine learning engineer. 2)Most of Machine Learning is Data Wrangling. If you're new to this space the one thingmany won't tell you is that much of the job of the data scientist and the machine learning engineer is massaging dirty data into a state where it can be modeled. In the real world data is dirty and before you can build accurate machine learning models you have to clean it. This process is called data wrangling and without this skills set you'll never get a job as a machine learning engineer. This course will give you the fundamentals you need to cleanse your data. 3)The Growth of Data is Insane. Ninety percent of all the world's data has been created in the last two years. Business around the world generate approximately 450 billion transactions a day. The amount of data collected by all organizations is approximately 2.5 exabytes a day.

My goal is to give data engineers what they need to know for the exam and provide learners with the foundations of TensorFlow onGoogle's Cloud Platform. At this juncture theGoogle Certified Data Engineer. is the onlyreal world certification. for data and machine learning engineers. TensorFlow. is an open source software library created by Goggle. for doing graph-based computations quickly.  It does this by utilizing the GPU(Graphics Processing Unit)and also making it easy to distribute the work across multiple GPUs and computers. Tensors. , in general, are simply arrays of numbers. , or functions, that transform according to certain rules under a change of conditions. Nodes . in the graphs represent mathematical operations. , while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays.  (tensors. ) communicated between them. In the courseyou'll discover how to apply TensorFlow to machine learning. , the concept of a Tensor. , the anatomy of a simple program, basic constructs such as constants, variables, placeholders, sessions. and the computation graph. You'll work with basic math operations.  and image transformations to see how common computations are performed. You'll.  learn TensorFlow.  within the context of the Google Cloud Platform.                               *Five Reasons to take this Course.*. 1) You Want to be a Data Engineer. It'sthe number one job in the world. (not just within the computer space)Thegrowth potential career wise is second to none. You want the freedom to moveanywhere you'd like. You want to be compensated for your efforts. You want tobe able to work remotely. The list of benefits goes on. 2) The Google Certified DataEngineer. Googleis always ahead of the game. If you were to look back at a timeline of theiraccomplishments in the data space you might believe they have a crystal ball.They've been a decade ahead of everyone. Now, they are the first and theonly cloud vendor to have a data engineering certification. With their trackrecord I'll go with Google. 3)The Growth of Data isInsane. Ninetypercent of all the world's data has been created in the last two years.Business around the world generate approximately 450 billions transactions aday. The amount of data collected by all organizations is approximately 2.5Exabytes a day. That number doubles every month. 4) TensorFlow in Plain English. TensorFlow is a low level language. The basic concept of a tenor is hard to grasp if you aren't familiar with neural networks. In the course we will break down TensorFlow in to bite sized pieces ensuring you learn the fundamentals first. After we've built a base understanding of tensors and how they flow we will move on to more complicated examples. 5) You want to be ahead of the Curve. The data engineer role is fairly new. While your learning, building your skills andbecoming certified you arealso the first to be part of this burgeoning field.

What if you could develop your skill-set in one of the most hottest Big Data technology i.e. Apache Spark by learning in one of the most comprehensive course out there (with 10+ hours of content. ) packed with dozens of hands-on real world examples, use-cases,challenges and best-practices?. What if you could learn from an instructor who is working in the world's largest consultancy firm,has worked,end-to-end,in Australia's biggest Big Data projects to date and whohas a proven track record on Udemy with highly positive reviews and thousands of students already enrolled in his previous course(s)?. If you have such aspirations and goals, then this course and you is a perfect match made in heaven!. Why Apache Spark?. Apache Spark has revolutionised and disrupted the waybig data processing andmachine learning were done by virtue of its unprecedented in-memory and optimised computational model. It has been unanimously hailed as the future of Big Data.It's the tool of choice all around the world whichallows data scientists, engineers and developers to acquire andprocess data for a number of use-cases likescalablemachine learning, stream processing and graph analytics to name a few.All of the leading organisations likeAmazon, Ebay, Yahoo among many others have embraced this technology to address their Big Data processing requirements. Additionally,Gartner has repeatedly highlighted Apache Spark as a leader in Data Science platforms. .Certification programs ofHadoop vendors like Cloudera and Hortonworks, which have high esteem in current industry, have oriented their curriculum to focus heavily on ApacheSpark. Almost all of the jobs in Big Data and Machine Learning space demand proficiency in Apache Spark. This is what John Tripier, Alliances and Ecosystem Lead at Databricks has to say, �The adoption of Apache Spark by businesses large and small is growing at an incredible rate across a wide range of industries, and the demand for developers with certified expertise is quickly following suit�. All of these facts correlate to the notion that learning this amazing technology will give you a strong competitive edge in your career. Why this course?. Firstly, this is the most comprehensive and in-depth course . ever produced on Apache Spark. I've carefully and critically surveyed all of the resources out there and almost all of them fail to cover this technology in the depth that it trulydeserves. Some of them lack coverage of Apache Spark's theoretical concepts like its architecture andhow it works in conjunction with Hadoop, some fall short in thoroughly describing how to use Apache Spark APIs optimally for complex big data problems, some ignore the hands-on aspects to demonstrate how to do Apache Spark programming to work on real-world use-casesand almost all of them don't cover the best practices in industryand the mistakes that many professionals make in field. This course addresses all of the limitations that's prevalent in the currently available courses. Apart from that, as I have attended trainings from leading Big Data vendors like Cloudera (for which they charge thousands of dollars), I've ensured that the course is aligned withthe educationalpatterns and best practices followed in those training to ensure that you get the best and most effective learning experience. Each section of the course covers concepts in extensive detail and from scratchso that you won't find any challenges in learning evenif you are new to this domain. Also, each section will have an accompanying assignment section where we will work together on a number of real-world challenges and use-cases . employing real-world data-sets. The data-sets themselves will also belong to different niches ranging from retail, web server logs, telecommunication and some of them will also be from Kaggle (world's leading Data Science competition platform). The course leverages Scala instead of Python. Even though wherever possible, reference to Python development is also given but the course ismajorly based on Scala. The decision was made based on a number of rational factors. Scala is the de-facto language for development in Apache Spark. Apache Spark itself is developed in Scala and as a result all of the new features are initially made available in Scala and then in other languages like Python. Additionally, there is significant performance difference when it comes to using Apache Spark with Scala compared to Python. Scala itself is one of the most highest paid programming languages and you will be developing strong skill in that language along the way as well. The course also has a number of quizzes to further test your skills. For further support, you can always ask questions to which you will get prompt response. I will also be sharing best practices and tips on regular basis with my students. What you are going to learn in this course?. The course consistsof majorly two sections:. Section - 1:. We'll start off withthe introduction of Apache Spark and will understand its potential and businessuse-cases in the context of overall Hadoop ecosystem. We'll then focus on howApache Spark actually works and will take a deep dive of the architectural componentsof Spark as its crucial for thorough understanding. Section - 2:. After developingunderstanding of Spark architecture, we will move to the next section of thiscourse where we will employ Scala language to use Apache Spark APIs to developdistributed computation programs. Please note that you don't need to have priorknowledge of Scala for this course as I will start with the very basics ofScala and as a result you will also be developing your skills in this one ofthe highest paying programming languages. In this section, Wewill comprehensively understand how spark performs distributed computationusing abstractions like RDDs, what are the caveatsin loading data in Apache Spark, what are thedifferent ways to create RDDs and how to leverage parallelism and much more. Furthermore, astransformations and action constitute the gist of Apache Spark APIs thus itsimperative to have sound understanding of these. Thus, we will thenfocus on a number of Spark transformations and Actions that are heavily beingused in Industry and will go into detail of each. Each API usage will becomplimented with a series of real-world examples and datasets e.g. retail, webserver logs, customer churn and also from kaggle. Each section of the coursewill have a number of assignments where you will be able to practically applythe learned concepts to further consolidate your skills. A significantsection of the course will also be dedicated to key value RDDs which form thebasis of working optimally on a number of big data problems. In addition tocovering the crux of Spark APIs, I will also highlight a number of valuablebest practices based on my experience and exposure and will also intuit onmistakes that many people do in field. You will rarely such informationanywhere else. Each topic will becovered in a lot of detail with strong emphasis on being hands-on thus ensuringthat you learn Apache Spark in the best possible way. The course isapplicable and valid for all versions of Spark i.e. 1.6 and 2.0. After completingthis course, you will develop a strong foundation and extended skill-set to useSpark on complex big data processing tasks. Big data is one of the mostlucractive career domains where data engineers claim salaries in high numbers.This course will also substantially help in your job interviews. Also, if youare looking to excel further in your big data career, by passing Hadoopcertifications . like of Cloudera and Hortonworks, this course will prove to beextremely helpful in that context as well. Lastly, once enrolled, you will have life-time access to the lectures and resources.Its a self-paced course and you can watch lecture videos on any device like smartphone or laptop.

At this juncture the Google Certified Data Engineer.  is the only real world certification.  for data and machine learning engineers. NOTE:.  This is NOT. a course on Big Data. This is a course on a specific cloud service called Google Cloud Dataproc. The course was designed to be part of a series . for those who want to become data engineers.  on Google's Cloud Platform. This course is all about Google's Cloud . and migrating . on-premise Hadoop jobs to GCP. In reality, Big Data . is simply about unstructured data.  There are two core types of data in the real world. The first is structured data. , this is the kind of data found in a relational database. The second is unstructured. , this is a file sitting on a file system. Approximately 90% of all data . in the enterprise is unstructured . and our job is to give it structure. Why.  do we want to give it structure. ? We want to give is structure so we can analyze it.  Recall that 99%.  of all applied machine learning is supervised learning. That simply means we have a data set . and we point our machine learning.  models.  at that data set in order to gain insight into that data. In the course . we will spend much of the time working in Cloud Dataproc.  This is Google�s managed Hadoop and Spark.  platform. Recall the end goal of big data . is to get that data into a state where it can be analyzed and modeled. Therefore, we are also going to cover how to work on machine learning projects with big data at scale. Please keep in mind this course alone will not give you.  the knowledge and skills to pass the exam. The course will provide you with the big data knowledge.  you need for working with Cloud Dataproc.  and for moving existing projects to the Google Cloud Platform.                               *Five Reasons to take this Course.*. 1) . The Top Job in the World. The data engineer role is the single most needed role in the world. Many believe that it's the data scientist but several studies have broken down the job descriptions and the most needed position is that of the data engineer. 2) . Google's the World Leader in Data. Amazon's AWS is the most used cloud and Azure has the best UIbut no cloud vendor in the world understands data like Google. They are the world leader in open sources artificial intelligence. You can't be the leader in AI without being the leader in data. 3).  90% of all Organizational Data is Unstructured. The study of big data is the study of unstructured data. As the data in companies grows most will need to scale to unprecedented level. Without a significant investment in infrastructure and talent this won't be possible without the cloud. 4) . The Data Revolution is Now. We are in a data revolution.Data used to be viewed as a simple necessity and lower on the totem pole. Now it is more widely recognized as the source of truth. As we move into more complex systems of data management, the role of the data engineer becomes extremely important as a bridge between the DBA and the data consumer. Beyond the ubiquitous spreadsheet, graduating from RDBMS (which will always have a place in the data stack), we now work with NoSQL and Big Data technologies. 5) Data is Foundation. Data engineers are the plumbers building a data pipeline, while data scientists are the painters and storytellers giving meaning to an otherwise static entity. Simply put, data engineers clean, prepare and optimize data for consumption. Once the data becomes useful, data scientists can perform a variety of analyses and visualization techniques to truly understand the data, and eventually, tell a story from the data.

You'll be able to import data sets and use SQL to explore them with BigQuery. When you've completed the course you'll be able to explain in detail why BigQuery is the fastest data warehouse in the world.","Welcome toServerless Data Analysis with Big Query on Google's Cloud. This is thesecond. course in a series of courses designed to help you attain the covetedGoogle Certified Data Engineer. Additionally. , the series of courses is going toshow you. the role of thedata engineer on the Google Cloud Platform. At this juncture theGoogle Certified Data Engineer. is the onlyreal world certification. for data and machine learning engineers. Note:.  This is not . a programmers . course on BigQuery. The goal . of this course and the entire series of courses.  is to provide students with the foundation of the services.  you'll need to know for the Google Certified Data Engineering Exam. Because SQL is a prerequisite for the course.  this course is mostly lecture. Don't let that lull to sleep though, this service is heavily covered.  on the exam. BigQuery is Google'sfully managed, petabyte scale, low cost enterprise data warehouse for analytics. BigQuery isserverless. There is no infrastructure to manage and you don't need a database administrator, so you can focus on analyzing data to find meaningful insights using familiar SQL. We.  are in a data revolution. .Data used to be viewed as a simple necessity and lower on the totem pole. Now . it is more widely recognized as the source of truth. As we move into more complex systems of data management, the role . of the data engineer becomes extremely important.  as a bridge between the DBA, developer and the data consumer. Beyond the ubiquitous spreadsheet, graduating from RDBMS (which will always have a place in the data stack), we now work with NoSQL and Big Data technologies. Most . cloud computing vendors are moving to a serverless architecture. What's serverless? Serverless is about abstracting users away from servers. , infrastructure. , and having to deal with low-level configuration or the core operating system. Instead, developers make use of single purpose services . to execute code. Imagine.  for a second being able to upload data . into a storage bucket and thenrun SQL like queries against it. Many data analysts call this the grail to data analysis. With BigQuery,.  that's exactly what you do. There's no spinning up or configuringanything.You upload . data in the form of a csv or json file and an query against it. I don't mean a hundred thousand rows. I mean a billion.                              *Five Reasons to take this Course.*. 1) You Want to be a Data Engineer. It's the number one job in the world.

Analytic functions compute an aggregate value based on a set of values, and, unlike aggregate functions, can return multiple rows for each set of values. If you want to run a query using only aggregate functions, the query will return one row with a column for each field. If you want to run a query using an aggregate function in conjunction with the GROUP BY function, the query will return one row for each value found in the grouped field. If you want to run a query using an analytic function, the query will return one row for each field in the defined range of fields used to perform the calculations.If you use an aggregate function with any other function in a query, one field in the query must contain the GROUP BY function. Analytic functions are frequently used in fields such as finance and science to provide trend, outlier, and bucketed analysis for large data sets. Unlike traditional aggregation functions, which return only a single value for each group defined in the query, Analytic functions return a single value for each input row .They increase the efficiency and reduce the complexity of queries that analyse partitions (windows) of a data set. This course will use aggregate and analytic functions to query and analyse data from a PostgreSQL database.",,Database Design & Development,,9.99,English,,data analysis,postgresql,,,,udemy,www.udemy.com,"DATABASE,SQL",,DATABASE,SQL,"DATABASE,SQL"

This course is from a software engineer who has managed to crack interviews in around 16 software companies. Sometimes, life gives us no time to prepare, There are emergency times where in we have to buck up our guts and start bringing the situations under our control rather then being in the control of the situation. At the end of the day, All leave this earth empty handed. But given a situation, we should live up or fight up in such a way that the whole action sequence should make us proud and be giving us goosebumps when we think about it right after 10 years. Apache Spark is an open-source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. Spark is Developed to utilize distributed, in-memory data structures to improve data processing speeds for most workloads, Spark performs up to 100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce for iterative algorithms. Spark supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. The PySpark API Utility Module enables the use of Python to interact with the Spark programming model. For programmers who arealready familiar with Python, the PySpark API provides easy access to the extremely high-performance data processing enabled by Spark�s Scala architecture �without really the need to learn any Scala. Though Scala is much more efficient, the PySpark API allows data scientists with experience of Python to write programming logic in the language mostfamiliar to them. They can use it to perform rapid distributed transformations on large sets of data, and get the results back in Python-friendly notation. PySpark transformations (such as map, flatMap, filter) return resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). The short functions are passed to RDD methods using Python�s lambda syntax, while longer functions are defined with the def keyword. PySpark automatically ships the requested functions to worker nodes. The worker nodes then run the Python processes and push the results back to SparkContext, which stores the data in the RDD. PySpark offers access via an interactive shell, providing a simple way to learn the API. This course has a lot of programs , single line statements which extensively explains the use of pyspark apis.Through programs and through small data sets we have explained how actually a file with big data sets is analyzed the required results are returned. The course duration is around 6 hours. We have followed the question and answer approach to explain the pyspark api concepts.We would request you to kindly check the list of pyspark questions in the course landing page and then if you are interested, you can enroll in the course.

Machine learning is a machine�s ability to make decisions or predictions based on previous exposure to data and extensive training. In other words, if a machine (program, app, etc.) improves its prediction accuracy through training then it has �learned�. Learn How Models Work. Computational graphs consist of a network of connected nodes (often called neurons). Each of these nodes typically has a weight and a bias that helps determine, given an input, which path is the most likely. There are 4 main components to building a machine learning program: data gathering and formatting, model building, training, and testing and evaluating. Data Gathering and Formatting. You will learn togather plenty of data for the model to learn from. All data should be formatted pretty much the same (images same size, same color scheme, etc.) and should be labelled. Also divide data into mutually exclusive training and testing sets. Model Building. You will learn to figure out which kind of model scheme works best and what kinds of algorithms work best for the problem you�re trying to solve. Training,Testing and Evaluating. The model can choose paths through the neural network or computational graph based upon the inputs for a particular run, as well as the weights and biases of neurons in the network. In supervised learning, we show the model what the correct outputs are for a given set of inputs and the model alters the weights and biases of neurons to minimize the difference between its output and the correct answer.

Introduction to Accounting Data Analytics and Visualization,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-accounting-data-analytics-visual,4.8,18,Ronald Guymon,19 hours,Beginner,,"Accounting has always been about analytical thinking. From the earliest days of the profession, Luca Pacioli emphasized the importance of math and order for analyzing business transactions. The skillset that accountants have needed to perform math and to keep order has evolved from pencil and paper, to typewriters and calculators, then to spreadsheets and accounting software. A new skillset that is becoming more important for nearly every aspect of business is that of big data analytics: analyzing large amounts of data to find actionable insights. This course is designed to help accounting students develop an analytical mindset and prepare them to use data analytic programming languages like Python and R. We�ve divided the course into three main sections. In the first section, we bridge accountancy to analytics. We identify how tasks in the five major subdomains of accounting (i.e., financial, managerial, audit, tax, and systems) have historically required an analytical mindset, and we then explore how those tasks can be. completed more effectively and efficiently by using big data analytics. We then present a FACT framework for guiding big data analytics: Frame a question, Assemble data, Calculate the data, and Tell others about the results. In the second section of the course, we emphasize the importance of assembling data. Using financial statement data, we explain desirable characteristics of both data and datasets that will lead to effective calculations and visualizations. In the third, and largest section of the course, we demonstrate and explore how Excel and Tableau can be used to analyze big data. We describe visual perception principles and then apply those principles to create effective visualizations. We then examine fundamental data analytic tools, such as regression, linear programming (using Excel Solver), and clustering in the context of point of sale data and loan data. We conclude by demonstrating the power of data analytic programming languages to assemble, visualize, and analyze data. We introduce Visual Basic for Applications. as an example of a programming language, and the Visual Basic Editor as an example of an integrated development environment (IDE).",,Data Analysis          Predictive Analytics          Data Visualization (DataViz)          Data Architecture          coding,Data Science,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,0.0,"Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish","big data analytic, big data, visualizations, calculations, regression, big data analytics, linear programming, clustering, data analytic, ply those principles to create effective visualizations. we then examine fundamental data analytic tools, such as regress, integrated development environment, visual perception principles, ide","excel solver, visual basic editor, excel, tableau",fact,,"python, visual basic, r"," calculate the data, frame a question, create effective visualizations, tell others about the results, assemble data",coursera,www.coursera.org,,,,,

You can move around the interface and create basic formulas.,"In an age now driven by ""big data"", we need to cut through the noise and present key information in a way that can be quickly consumed and acted upon making data visualization an increasingly important skill. Visualizations need to not only present data in an easy to understand and attractive way, but they must also provide context for the data, tell a story, achieving that fine balance between form and function. Excel has many rivals in this space, but it is still an excellent choice, particularly if it's where your data resides. It offers a wealth of tools for creating visualizations other than charts and the chart options available are constantly increasing and improving, so the newer versions now include waterfall charts, sunburst diagrams and even map charts. But what sets Excel apart is its flexibility, it gives us total creative control over our designs so if needed we could produce our own animated custom chart to tell the right story for our data. Over five weeks we will explore Excel's rich selection of visualization tools using practical case studies as seen through the eyes of Rohan, an environmental analyst. Rohan is required to produce visualizations that will show trends, forecasts, breakdowns and comparisons for a large variety of environmental data sets. As well as utilising the usual chart types he wants to use conditional formats, sparklines, specialised charts and even create his own animated charts and infographics. In some cases, he will also need to prepare the data using pivot tables to drill down and answer very specific questions. We are going to help him achieve all this and present our finished visualizations in attractive reports and dashboards that use tools like slicers and macros for automation and interactivity.These are the topics we will cover:Week 1: 	Dynamic visualizations with conditional formatting, custom number formatting, sparklines and macrosWeek 2: 	Charting techniques for telling the right storyWeek 3: 	Creating specialised and custom chartsWeek 4: 	Summarising and filtering data with pivot tables and pivot chartsWeek 5: 	Creating interactive dashboards in ExcelThis is the second course in our Specialization on Data Analytics and Visualization.

Why use C# and Unity instead of some other language and game engine? Well, C# is a really good language for learning how to program and then programming professionally. Also, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers; Unity games were downloaded 16,000,000,000 times in 2016! Finally, C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment. This course assumes you have the prerequisite knowledge from the previous three courses in the specialization. You should make sure you have that knowledge, either by taking those previous courses or from personal experience, before tackling this course. The required prerequisite knowledge is listed in the ""Who this class is for"" section below. Throughout this course you'll build on your foundational C# and Unity knowledge by developing more robust games with better object-oriented designs using various data structures and design patterns.Data structures and design patterns are both general programming and software architecture topics that span all software, not just games. Although we'll discuss these ideas in the game domain, they also apply if you're writing a web app in ASP.NET, building a tool using WinForms, or any other software you decide to build.

Data Mining Project,https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-mining-project,4.6,6,"Jiawei Han,ChengXiang Zhai,John C. Hart",11 hours,,,"Note: You should complete all the other courses in this Specialization before beginning this course. This six-week long Project course of the Data Mining Specialization will allow you to apply the learned algorithms and techniques for data mining from the previous courses in the Specialization, including Pattern Discovery, Clustering, Text Retrieval, Text Mining, and Visualization, to solve interesting real-world data mining challenges. Specifically, you will work on a restaurant review data set from Yelp and use all the knowledge and skills you�ve learned from the previous courses to mine this data set to discover interesting and useful knowledge. The design of the Project emphasizes: 1) simulating the workflow of a data miner in a real job setting; 2) integrating different mining techniques covered in multiple individual courses; 3) experimenting with different ways to solve a problem to deepen your understanding of techniques; and 4) allowing you to propose and explore your own ideas creatively. The goal of the Project is to analyze and mine a large Yelp review data set to discover useful knowledge to help people make decisions in dining. The project will include the following outputs: 1. Opinion visualization: explore and visualize the review content to understand what people have said in those reviews.2. Cuisine map construction: mine the data set to understand the landscape of different types of cuisines and their similarities.3. Discovery of popular dishes for a cuisine: mine the data set to discover the common/popular dishes of a particular cuisine.4. Recommendation of restaurants to help people decide where to dine: mine the data set to rank restaurants for a specific dish and predict the hygiene condition of a restaurant.From the perspective of users, a cuisine map can help them understand what cuisines are there and see the big picture of all kinds of cuisines and their relations. Once they decide what cuisine to try, they would be interested in knowing what the popular dishes of that cuisine are and decide what dishes to have. Finally, they will need to choose a restaurant. Thus, recommending restaurants based on a particular dish would be useful. Moreover, predicting the hygiene condition of a restaurant would also be helpful. By working on these tasks, you will gain experience with a typical workflow in data mining that includes data preprocessing, data exploration, data analysis, improvement of analysis methods, and presentation of results. You will have an opportunity to combine multiple algorithms from different courses to complete a relatively complicated mining task and experiment with different ways to solve a problem to understand the best way to solve it. We will suggest specific approaches, but you are highly encouraged to explore your own ideas since open exploration is, by design, a goal of the Project. You are required to submit a brief report for each of the tasks for peer grading. A final consolidated report is also required, which will be peer-graded.",,Data Clustering Algorithms          Data Analysis          Natural Language Processing          Data Mining,Data Science,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,0.0,"Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, Korean, German, Russian, English, Spanish","algorithms, data mining, visualization, map construction",,,,,"data analysis, text retrieval, simulating the workflow of a data miner, improvement of analysis methods, solve interesting real-world data mining challenges, visualization, text mining, clustering, solve a problem, pattern discovery, apply the learned algorithms and techniques, integrating different mining techniques, data preprocessing, recommending restaurants based on a particular dish, propose and explore your own ideas, presentation of results, data exploration",coursera,www.coursera.org,,,,,

From practice of teaching statistics, it became clear that it is difficult for learners to put together a broad field map if they have taken only a few of the different topics on analytical tools. As a result, they do not see the overall picture of everything that the field of data analysis has to offer. This course is designed to fill this gap. It is a survey course on state-of-the-art in interdisciplinary methods of data analysis, applicable to business and academia alike. Unlike other statistical courses, which focus on specific methods, this course will focus on the broader areas within statistics and data analytics. There are five major topics it will cover. It will start with the root of it all - the data � and some of the problems with the data. Then it will move through the contemporary approaches to descriptive, inferential, predictive and prescriptive analytics.Within each broader topic, the course will offer the theoretical foundation behind the methods without focusing too much on the mathematics. It will provide historical references, examples, explanations and case studies to illustrate the main concepts within each broader topic. In doing so, it will introduce the applied, problem-based approach to using specific tools. Then, it will discuss some of the specific of a particular approach. Overall, after taking this course, the students will get a good understanding of the state-of-the-art tools that the field of data analysis currently has to offer.The course consists of two parts.

Calculus through Data & Modelling: Integration Applications,https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus-through-data-and-modelling-integration-applications,0.0,0,"Joseph W. Cutrone, PhD",6 hours,Intermediate,Some working knowledge of differentiable calculus.,"This course continues your study of calculus by focusing on the applications of integration. The applications in this section have many common features. First, each is an example of a quantity that is computed by evaluating a definite integral. Second, the formula for that application is derived from Riemann sums. Rather than measure rates of change as we did with differential calculus, the definite integral allows us to measure the accumulation of a quantity over some interval of input values. This notion of accumulation can be applied to different quantities, including money, populations, weight, area, volume, and air pollutants. The concepts in this course apply to many other disciplines outside of traditional mathematics.We will expand the notion of the average value of a data set to allow for infinite values, develop the formula for arclength and curvature, and derive formulas for velocity, acceleration, and areas between curves. Through examples and projects, we will apply the tools of this course to analyze and model real world data.",,,Math and Logic,Johns Hopkins University,0.0,Subtitles: English,"integration, rates of change, calculus, definite integral, riemann sums",,,,,"measure the accumulation of a quantity, analyze and model real world data",coursera,www.coursera.org,CALCULUS,,,,CALCULUS

Using Asylo to Protect Secret Data from an Attacker with Root Privileges,https://www.coursera.org/learn/asylo-protect-secret-data,0.0,0,Google Cloud Training,1 hour,Intermediate,,"In this Google Cloud Lab, you build a simple example enclave. The example demonstrates initializing an enclave, passing arguments to code running inside the enclave, encrypting those arguments inside the enclave, and returning the processed results. Even though this is a very simple example, it demonstrates the basic functionality provided by Asylo and the steps required to utilize that functionality. What is Asylo?Asylo is an open-source framework for developing enclave applications. It defines an abstract enclave model that can be mapped transparently onto a variety of enclave technologies (a.k.a., enclave backends). Asylo provides a software-development platform that supports a growing range of use cases. In a sense, the enclave backend can be viewed as a special-purpose embedded computer running inside a conventional machine, with Asylo providing the necessary runtime for that embedded computer.What is an enclave?On traditional systems, the Operating System (OS) kernel has unrestricted access to a machine's hardware resources. The kernel typically exposes most of its access permissions to a root user without any restrictions. Additionally, a root user can extend or modify the kernel on a running system. As a result, if an attacker can execute code with root privileges, they can compromise every secret and bypass every security policy on the machine. For instance, if an attacker obtains root access on a machine that manages TLS keys, those keys may be compromised.Enclaves are an emerging technology paradigm that changes this equation. An enclave is a special execution context where code can run protected from even the OS kernel, with the guarantee that even a user running with root privileges cannot extract the enclave's secrets or compromise its integrity. Such protections are enabled through hardware isolation technologies such as Intel SGX or ARM TrustZone, or even through additional software layers such as a hypervisor. These technologies enable new forms of isolation beyond the usual kernel/user-space separation.New security features are exciting for developers building secure applications, but in practice there is a big gap between having a raw capability and developing applications that leverage that capability. Building useful enclave applications requires tools to construct, load, and operate enclaves. Doing useful work in an enclave requires programming-language support and access to core platform libraries.Note: you will have timed access to the online environment. You will need to complete the lab within the allotted time.",,enclave applications          Enclave          security          Asylo,Information Technology,Google Cloud,0.0,English,"operating system, hardware isolation, kernel, tls keys, software-development, os kernel, enclave, enclave technologies",,asylo,google cloud lab,,"building secure applications, construct, load, and operate enclaves, building useful enclave applications",coursera,www.coursera.org,,,,,
